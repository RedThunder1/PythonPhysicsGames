# Python Physics Sims
In this repository I will be creating little physics sims using pygame for visuals and math to simulate certain physics scenarios.

The first and current sim is a ball bouncing around the inside of a containing circle.

These sims aren't anything more than just little projects I wanted to make so they wont have any practical use (likely) and they will be far from perfect. Despite that I want to make them as realistic and efficent as possible. As I create more I may up the difficulty of the sims to help myself learn more. Anyways if you are here at this repository I hope you enjoy this dumb little sims.
