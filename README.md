# Python Physics Sims
In this repository I will be creating little physics sims using pygame for visuals and math to simulate certain physics scenarios.

The first and current sim is a ball bouncing around the inside of a containing circle.

These sims aren't anything more than just little projects I wanted to make so they wont have any practical use (likely) and they will be far from perfect. Despite that I want to make them as realistic and efficent as possible. As I create more I may up the difficulty of the sims to help myself learn more. Anyways if you are here at this repository I hope you enjoy this dumb little sims.

## Ball Sim
Currently the ball sim is not complete. The two big issues currently is properly simulating bounces and stopping it from bouncing past the border. First step is fixing the bounces as it may help with the other issue but if not that will be the next fix. After those two I will do some qol changes and fixes to help make the sim a lot better and then I might move onto another one.
